\item{train_points_high}{A vector containing the training points of the high-level.}
}
\value{
A block matrix \code{cov_matr_block} containing the posterior covariance of the
GP posterior for the two-level approximation.
}
\description{
Compute the ovariance matrix of the two-level Gaussian process posterior.
